# CarM8
   Not all drivers have a new vehicle that comes with the support of a dealership reminding them of their vehicles
required maintenance. CarM8, <i> will support their users by ridding them of having to remember when their vehicle 
needs maintenance. </i> By providing information on their vehicle the application will provide a recommended vehicle 
maintenance schedule and provide it users at no cost. By compiling a full list of vital vehicle maintenance users
can free that hole in the back of their mind consumed by the worry that maybe this next time they go to turn on 
their car it just might not come on. Most vehicles remind you when they need an oil change but don’t notify you 
of many of other maintenance procedures to include but not limited to: tire rotation, battery visual checks, 
brake pad replacement, brake fluid swap, radiator flush, transmission fluid change, drive belt visual inspection,
checking oil levels, engine air filter, cabin air filter.
## Maintenence Schedule, and Miles Per Gallon
  Additionally, another feature CarM8 has will offer is an MPG calculator. When car shopping, the fuel economy 
bolstered by dealerships is often times a chief consideration alongside safety or warranty. As vehicles age however
and the drivers along with their vehicle have long been forgotten by their dealership, that MPG rating may not be
where it once was. With CarM8, <i> users can provide the size of their gas tank, the date they put gas, the odometer
reading, and the amount of gasoline they have purchased</i>. This process will be repeated the next time they visit
the gas station and <i>CarM8 will provide an MPG report featuring not only the current state of their fuel economy
but how many miles they’ve driven, and the days since their last visit to the pump.</i> Providing users with an
understanding of how their MPG may have changed over time, the underlying health of their vehicle and how their
driving habits may or may not be affect their bottom dollar. 
  
  Any step we can take towards understanding our own carbon footprint is a good step! CarM8 strives to be an
  application leveraged by every driver but is centralized behind drivers with three reservations:
  
#### 1. The longevity of their vehicle(s)
#### 2. The environmental impact of their driving
#### 3. The cost of their driving

  If you concern yourself with any of those three listed above. CarM8 could be for you.
